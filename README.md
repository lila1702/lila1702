## Things I like ❤️
- 📝 I like drawing (I made my profile pic) :smile:
- 🕹️ I love playing games (My favorite genres are RPGs and Casual games)
- 📓 I also (kinda) like writing stories, but mostly, just so I can draw random scenes I imagine
- 💡 I also like making simple games to test my programming capabilities (On Unity mostly, other times without an especific engine)
- ⛓️ Emotionally attached to everything Nintendo (and without the 💰 to afford it) 🥲

## My university jorney ✏️
- 🏆 I learned python on my first semester of software engineering, and, in general, it has become one of my favorite programming languages since.
- 🏆 I learned the basics of C on my second semester, and while very different from what I was used to, it was an interesting experience.
- 🏆 Learned the basics of Java and reviewed OOP concepts on my third semester, also learnead some algorithms that are used with graph data structures.
- 🏆 On my fourth semester, I learned about DataBases with PostgreSQL, and learned algorithm analysis and the most common algorithms.
- 🏆 I'm on my fifth semester learning about the workings of Operating Systems and Computer Networks.
