## Who am I? üíú
I'm a Software Engineer (finishing university) and Game Enthusiast. It's been the reason I became interested in the area, and it's how I measure my evolution through the years.
I love Python and C# as languages, and have been slowly exploring what I can do with it, like web scraping, automatization of tasks, back-end development for web, and, of course, games.

## Experiences üíª
- Currently, I am an intern in software development for a company responsible for developing a web application for managing posthumous wishes and wills, with a focus on facilitating post-life planning while still in life.
- I also participate on an Extension Project at my university that is focused on helping students learn skills of various kinds and prepare themselves for the professional market, via courses, lectures, presentations and via social media.
