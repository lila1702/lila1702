- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lila1702.
- ğŸ‘€ I like drawing and making simple small games in Unity.
- ğŸŒ± I learned python on my first semester of software engineering, and, in general, it has become one of my favorite programming languages since.
- ğŸŒ± I learned the basics of C on my second semester, and while very different from what I was used to, it was an interesting experience.
- ğŸŒ± Learned the basics of Java and reviewed OOP concepts on my third semester, also learnead some algorithms that are used with graph data structures.
- ğŸŒ± I'm on my fourth semester learning about Code Bases, like SQL and such, and learning algorithms more thoroughly.
